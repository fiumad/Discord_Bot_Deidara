To use, create a config.json file in your root directory. Include key-value pairs for the prefix
you would like to use, your bot's token, the array of deidara quotes (included in deidara quotes.txt),
and the channel ID for the voice channel you would like it join. Keys for these values are called on 
line 3 of index.js. This project requires that you have node.js, discord.js, and ytdl installed.
